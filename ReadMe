Video Damonstration is still rendering. Video will be available this evening, May 15, 2021. 
Updates are still ongoing due to delay of starting the project. Nevertheless, we will try to finish on time, else we'd still pass it late but completed.

This is the project of Group 2 CPE106L, instructor: Engr. Dionis Padilla.

The Project is named CCT DAMS.

The Covid-19 Contact Tracing Database Management System, or the CCT DAMS, is a database management system made for contact tracing registrations. 
During the pandemic, contact tracers had a hard time tracking down people who had previous close contact with the infected people. This program 
allows the contact tracers to easily record and manage the recorded names and details of people they wish to add to the lists of monitoring. The 
program will also take proper consideration on simplicity as some users are not computer literates, thus, it will consist of simple features like 
the main interface for the management of registrations and updating of contacted peopleâ€™s details.The goal of the program is to simulate the 
registration interface and the viewing of the listed details from the registration interface.

Two methods to run the program:
1. Use the Shortcut link "OFFICIAL CCT  DAMS Program", found at program folder PythonApplication1 or 
go to program folder PythonApplication1 >> dist >> CCTDdb_FrontEnd>> find Application file "OFFICIAL CCT  DAMS Program" >> open/double click.
Running with this method would mean that the database will be located at the said dist/CCTDdb_FrontEnd folder.

2. In command terminal, run the CCTDdb_FrontEnd.py. Running with this method would mean that the database used is in the current folder where
the said python file is located.
